# oi.client.hololens

This Unity project for the Microsoft Hololens provides the basic functionality
for the "On-Site Operator" client. I.e. the marker-based kinect alignment and 
sharing of the spatial mesh with the "Remote Operator".

This project is for Unity 2017.4 (LTS), and requires the HoloToolkit 2017.4 unity package to be included:
